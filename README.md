# React IMDB - Movie & TV Search

An app built to interact with the IMDB database to fetch both Movies and TV Shows based on a user search. There is also features to checkout upcoming Movies, TV Shows airing on that day, and to see recommended Movies or TV Shows relative to the item the User clicks the 'Recommended' button on.

## Tech

Started by using the Create-React-App.

- React
  - To build the front-end of the app and track the state of the User search
- Express
  - To simplify the server-side routing sitting on top of Node.js
- Node
  - To build the server, along with Express, and allow interactions with the database

**Additional**

- React Router
  - To create a seamless UI and navigation between views


### In Progress

Converting to a Full-Stack MERN app. Performing the change to eventually include a _Favorites_ feature where a User would be able to save a Movie or TV Show to reference later.

### TODOs

- Fix broken search function resulting from partial conversion to Full-Stack (shoulda kept that separate branch!)
- Style the landing page further

### Future Features

- Finish the conversion to Full-Stack to allow saving User favorites
- Implement Framer-Motion for some basic animations
